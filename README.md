# CodeMash 2.0.1.6 Precompiler
AN INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (OR “MEET YOUR ROBOT OVERLORDS”)

In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the general concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and be given an opportunity to implement their own AI algorithm on a physical robot.

In part 1 of the workshop, participants will learn broad AI concepts and approaches, plus how to use advanced search techniques to solve complex problems using specialized heuristics. Additionally, attendees will learn basic Machine Learning principles and how to pose problems in such a way that the computer can learn from the past. All participants will have an opportunity to gain hands-on experience implementing a popular algorithm to solve a real-world problem.

In part 2, participants will build and train their bots to compete against each other (or against themselves) in a Battle of the Ages (or at least of CodeMash) using the skills they learned previously. Alternatively, participants may choose to pit their own wits against the coming Robot Overlords by implementing a human-designed solution to the given task and seeing how it fairs against the AI. No prior robotics experience is required, and robot hardware will be available for participants to use as part of the workshop.
