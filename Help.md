## Johnny-Five

One of the best places to get started with learning Johnny-Five is the official [Johnny-Five website](http://johnny-five.io/).

There is a growing and friendly Johnny-Five and Nodebots community that also loves to help.
Many of the Johnny-Five maintainers and active users have agreed to be online using Gitter to help
answer any questions you have during the workshop.

Chat Now: [Johnny-Five Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/rwaldron/johnny-five)

You might also enjoy this presentation from Johnny-Five's creator Rick Waldron from [JSConf 2015 Nodebots Day](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3531958/jsconf-2015/index.html).
It walks you through basics of using the library to control servos, LEDs, etc.
