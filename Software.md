# Software

## Raspberry Pi 2

Depending on whether you want to use C# or JavaScript to code your robot, you'll need to either load Win10 (default) or Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi.

### Win10

### Raspbian


## ML / AI algorithms
Here are some ML / AI algorithms in C# and Javascript that you may choose to use for your robot. Or use your own implementation from Part 1 of the workshop!

### C# #


### JavaScript



## Robot examples
Because we have a limited time for this workshop, we have provided working sample robot code in both C# and JavaScript to get you started. If you participated in the Nodebots workshop or just want to build your own, feel free! Your goal is to replace the manual robot control with your ML/AI algorithm to solve the task. 

### C# #

1. Ensure that you are running Win10 on your Pi
2. ...
3. Add your algorithm to solve the chosen task
4. 

### JavaScript
Our example JS code uses the Johnny-Five library for controlling your robot.

1. Ensure that you are running Raspbian on your Pi
2. Create a project directory and clone our sample repo
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`
4. Add your algorithm to solve the chosen task
