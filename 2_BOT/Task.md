# Autonomous Line Follower Robot

The primary task for this workshop is to build an autonomous line follower robot.

You'll be supplied with black electrical tape that you can use to construct practice paths.
We'll also make a few larger ones to really challenge you.

When first getting started, we recommend just making straight lines and/or subtle zig-zag patterns.
Curves can be particularly difficult, especially if they are sharp turns.

Remember from Part 1 of the workshop: you'll need to train your learner and build a model, then use it to predict the correct action to take in autonomous mode.

In this case, you'll probably want to manually drive the bot around and capture the values from the line sensor along with the manual drive input you're giving the bot. Use those to build your model. Then in autonomous mode, input the sensor values and attempt to predict the correct direction to turn.
